ADVANCED TOP INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

**1. What is Exploratory Testing?**
Exploratory testing is a hands-on approach in which testers are involved in minimum planning and maximum test execution. The planning involves the creation of a test charter, a short declaration of the scope of a short (1 to 2 hour) time-boxed test effort, the objectives and possible approaches to be used. The test design and test execution activities are performed in parallel typically without formally documenting the test conditions, test cases, or test scripts. This does not mean that other, more formal testing techniques will not be used. For example, the tester may decide to use boundary value analysis but will think through and test the most important boundary values without necessarily writing them down. Some notes will be written during the exploratory-testing session so that a report can be produced afterward.

**2. What is “use case testing”?**
In order to identify and execute the functional requirement of an application from start to finish “use case” is used and the technique used to do this is known as “Use Case Testing.”

**3. What is the difference between the STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?**
SDLC deals with the development/coding of the software while STLC deals with validation and verification of the software

**4. What is the traceability matrix?**
The relationship between test cases and requirements is shown with the help of a document. This document is known as a traceability matrix.

**5. What is Equivalence partitioning testing?**
Equivalence partitioning testing is a software testing technique that divides the application input test data into each partition at least once of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived. This testing method reduces the time required for software testing.

**6. What are white box testing and list the types of white box testing?**
The white box testing technique involves the selection of test cases based on an analysis of the internal structure (Code coverage, branches coverage, paths coverage, condition coverage, etc.) of a component or system. It is also known as Code-Based testing or Structural testing. Different types of white box testing are
1. Statement Coverage
2. Decision Coverage

**7. In white box testing, what do you verify?**
In white-box testing following steps are verified.
1. Verify the security holes in the code
2. Verify the incomplete or broken paths in the code
4. Verify the flow of structure according to the document specification

6. Verify all conditional loops in the code to check the complete functionality of the application
7. Verify the line by line coding and cover 100% testing

**9. What is black box testing? What are the different black-box testing techniques?**
Black box testing is the software testing method that is used to test the software without knowing the internal structure of the code or program. This testing is usually done to check the functionality of an application. The different black box testing techniques are
1. Equivalence Partitioning
2. Boundary value analysis
3. Cause-effect graphing

**10. What is the difference between static and dynamic testing?**
Static testing: During the Static testing method, the code is not executed, and it is performed using the software documentation. Dynamic testing: To perform this testing the code is required to be in an executable form.

**11. What are verification and validation?**
Verification is a process of evaluating software at the development phase. It helps you to decide whether the product of a given application satisfies the specified requirements. Validation is the process of evaluating software after the development process and checking whether it meets the customer requirements.

**15. What is the difference between UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System testing?**
System Testing: System testing is finding defects when the system undergoes testing as a whole; it is also known as end-to-end testing. In such type of testing, the application suffers from beginning till the end. UAT: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves running a product through a
series of specific tests which determine whether the product will meet the needs of its users.

**16. Mention the difference between Data-Driven Testing and Retesting?**
Retesting: It is a process of checking bugs that are actioned by the development team to verify that they are fixed. Data-Driven Testing (DDT): In the data-driven testing process, the application is tested with multiple test data. The application is tested with a different set of values.
**17. What are the valuable steps to resolve issues while testing?**
• Record: Log and handle any problems which have happened
• Report: Report the issues to a higher-level manager
• Control: Define the issue management process

**18. What is the difference between test scenarios, test cases, and test scripts?**
The difference between test scenarios and test cases is that Test scenario: A Test Scenario is any functionality that can be tested. It is
also called Test Condition or Test Possibility.
Test Cases: It is a document that contains the steps that have to be executed; it has been planned earlier.
Test Script: It is written in a programming language and it’s a short program used to test part of the functionality of the software system. In other words, a written set of steps should be performed manually.

**19. What is a Latent defect?**
Latent defect: This defect is an existing defect in the system which does not cause any failure as the exact set of conditions has never been met

**20. What are the two parameters which can be useful to know the quality of test execution?**
To know the quality of test execution, we can use two parameters
• Defect reject ratio

**27. What is fault-masking explain with example?**
When the presence of one defect hides the presence of another defect in the system, it is known as fault masking. Example: If the “Negative Value” causes a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.

**28. Explain what Test Plan is? What is the information that should be covered in Test Plan?**

c) Log the defect

**43. Explain what is “Test Plan Driven” or “Key Word Driven” method of testing is?**
This technique uses the actual test case document developed by testers using a spreadsheet containing special “key Words”. The keywords control the processing.

**44. What is the DFD (Data Flow Diagram)?**
When a “flow of data” through an information system is graphically represented, then it is known as Data Flow Diagram. It is also used for the
visualization of data processing.

**45. Explain what LCSAJ is?**
LCSAJ stands for ‘linear code sequence and jump.’ It consists of the following three items
a) Start of the linear sequence of executable statements
b) End of the linear sequence
c) The target line to which control flow is transferred at the end of the linear sequence

**47. Explain what N+1 testing is?**
The variation of regression testing is represented as N+1. In this technique, the testing is performed in multiple cycles in which errors found in the test cycle ‘N’ are resolved and re-tested in test cycle N+1. The cycle is repeated unless there are no errors found.

**48. What is Fuzz testing and when it is used?**
Fuzz testing is used to detect security loopholes and coding errors in software. In this technique, random data is added to the system in an attempt to crash the system. If vulnerability persists, a tool called fuzz tester is used to determine potential causes. This technique is more useful for bigger projects but only detects a major fault.

**49. Mention the main advantages of the statement coverage metric of software testing are? The benefit of statement coverage metric is that**
a) It does not require processing source code and can be applied directly to object code
b) Bugs are distributed evenly through the code, due to which percentage of executable statements covered reflects the percentage of faults discovered

**50. How to generate test cases for the “replace a string” method?**
a) If characters in new string > characters in the previous string. None of the characters should get truncated
b) If characters in new string< characters in the previous string. Junk characters should not be added
c) Spaces after and before the string should not be deleted
d) String should be replaced only for the first occurrence of the string

**51. How will you handle a conflict amongst your team members?**
• I will talk individually to each person and note their concerns
• I will find a solution to the common problems raised by team members
• I will hold a team meeting, reveal the solution and ask people to cooperate

**52. Mention what are the categories of defects?**
Mainly there are three defect categories
• Wrong: When a requirement is implemented incorrectly
• Missing: It is a variance from the specification, an indication that a the specification was not implemented or a requirement of the customer is not met
• Extra: A requirement incorporated into the product that was not given by the end customer. It is considered a defect because it is a variance from the existing requirements.
